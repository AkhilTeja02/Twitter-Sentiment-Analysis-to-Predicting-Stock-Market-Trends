# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-to-Predicting-Stock-Market-Trends
## Business Statement:
We see much news on Twitter; many people comment and talk about different things. It needs to be clarified if these things affect the companies involved. In our project, we look at tweets to see what people say about different companies. Later, we do a sentimental analysis of those tweets to find out how people feel about those companies. The next step is to see if these tweets change the price of a company's stock. If they are making a difference, we will see if there is a clear pattern. In other words, the main goal of our project is to find out if there is a link between what people are saying on Twitter and how the stock market moves. 

## Objectives
- Collecting a large dataset of tweets related to specific stocks or the overall stock market using the Twitter API and storing the data we are using MongoDB.​
- Preprocessing the text data using Pyspark's NLP libraries, such as NLTK or spaCy, to remove stop words, tokenize the text, and perform stemming or lemmatization.​
- Developing a sentiment analysis model using Pyspark's machine learning libraries, such as MLlib or TensorFlow, to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral.​
- Analyzing the sentiment trends over time using Pyspark's data manipulation and visualization libraries, such as Pandas and Matplotlib, to identify potential correlations between sentiment and stock market trends.
### If we Identify a pattern:​
- Developing a predictive model using Pyspark's machine learning libraries to forecast stock market trends based on the sentiment analysis results.​
- Evaluating the accuracy and reliability of the predictive model using cross-validation and other techniques provided by Pyspark's ML libraries.​
- Creating visualizations to present the sentiment analysis results and predicted stock market trends using powerBI/tableau.
